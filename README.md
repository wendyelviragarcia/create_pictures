This folder contains a set of scripts for creating a spectrogram figure (with or without annotation) of a sound file in Praat. Choose the script that serves your purpose better and download that .praat file.
- Pictures for all files in a folder
- Picture for a selected sound (without annotation)
- Picture for a selected sound and TextGrid (with annotation)

# DESCRIPTION
 This script creates and saves pictures (PNG, PDF, wmf, eps, PraatPic) of all the Sound and TextGrid files it finds in a folder.
	
The pictures contain a waveform (optional), a spectrogram(optional), the F0 track (optional) and a the content of the tiers of the TextGrid associated with the sound file (optional). 
 
The script is designed to carry out some operations automatically:
	
1. If you are drawing a TextGrid, it recognizes automatically the number of tiers in EACH textgrid and draws the picture consequently (i.e. in the picture there will be no unnecessary white space between the tiers and the spectrogram). 
2. It converts the TextGrid to backslash trigraphs before drawing, so you won't have problems plotting symbols like % or ¡
3. It detects automatically the F0 range of the picture of EACH sentence (unless you choose to specify it manually). 
4. In order to correct those cases in which Praat detects F0 in fricatives (what Boersma calls "to hallucinate pitches") the script gets the pitch from a filtered sound in which all frequencies beyond 1000Hz have been cancelled. 
5. It establishes automatically the number of marks on the y axis and their placement. It places the first mark at the lowest multiple of 50 Hz within the range of the picture (e.g. at 50 Hz, or 100 Hz, or 150 Hz...). The following marks are placed every 50/100/150 Hz (depending on the range of the utterance).  
	
In the INSTRUCTIONS section you will find details about the other characteristics and options of the script (e.g changing the dynamic range, choosing the level of smooth in the F0 track, changing the axis' names, choosing the speakers range of F0...)
 	 

# INSTRUCTIONS
The specific instructions for each script are detailed at the beggining of the .praat file. Remember a Praat file is only a .txt file that you can open with your **plain** text editor (such as Notepad++, Sublimetext, Atom...)
